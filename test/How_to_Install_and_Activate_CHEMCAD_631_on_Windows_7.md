## Installation of RMS License Manager Server
 
Before you can install and activate CHEMCAD 6.3.1, you need to install the RMS License Manager Server on your computer or network server. This program authorizes and manages the network licenses for CHEMCAD. To install the RMS License Manager Server, follow these steps:
 
1. Obtain RMS\_setup.zip and RMS\_admin.zip from Chemstations Inc., the developer of CHEMCAD. You can contact them by phone at 713-978-7700, by fax at 713-978-7727, or by e-mail at license@chemstations.com.
2. Extract the contents of RMS\_setup.zip and run Setup.exe to install the server program. Accept the default settings during the installation.
3. Extract the contents of RMS\_admin.zip and copy them to any directory on your local machine. These are the administrator tools that you will use to activate and monitor your CHEMCAD licenses.

## Activation of RMS License Manager Server
 
After installing the RMS License Manager Server, you need to activate your CHEMCAD licenses using the unique codes generated by your computer. To activate your licenses, follow these steps:

1. Run Wechoid.exe from the directory where you copied the administrator tools. This program displays details for your computer and generates locking data, which are used to create license files for you.
2. Uncheck all fields except Ethernet Address (or IP Address if you are using a virtual server). This sets the locking data that Chemstations uses to create your license files.
3. Press [ALT + PRINT SCREEN] on your keyboard to capture an image of the Wechoid dialog box. Then open your preferred word processor or graphics program, paste the screen image into a new document, and save the document as a common file type (such as .doc, .bmp, .jpg, or .pdf).
4. Create a new e-mail message and attach your screen capture document as a file attachment. In the body of the message, include the values from the Host Name, Selector, and Code fields. For the Code value, it is important that you copy and paste the text (not the image) to ensure that no characters are missed.
5. Send the e-mail message to maryh@chemstations.com. Chemstations staff will use your codes to generate licensing files, which will be sent back to you.
6. When you receive the licensing files from Chemstations, save them into the same directory as your administrator tools.
7. Run WlmAdmin.exe from the same directory to start the WlmAdmin program. This program allows you to view and manage your CHEMCAD licenses.
8. Expand the Subnet Servers list on the left side of the screen until you see your server number.
9. Select your server number and click File > Install Licenses from the menu bar.
10. Browse to the location where you saved your licensing files and select them. Click Open to install them.
11. You should see a confirmation message that your licenses have been installed successfully.
